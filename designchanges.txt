CHANGES BETWEEN THE DESIGN DOCUMENT AND THE FINISHED PRODUCT:

- We decided not to implement Bell Warnings, as sending people notifications would become too obnoxious, and we didn't want to collect phone numbers and invade anyone's privacy.
- We did not use a color alerts system, as it would've been a bit too distracting/not crucial enough for the home page.
- Mr. Brooks won't need to update the weekly bell schedules... Ms. Damasek will, instead! (or one of her assistants...)
- Admin has special page for updating bell schedules, that no one else can access
- Certain features (outlined in the Readme) are still rough or partially developed, and still in ongoing development as per Mr. Brook's request!
