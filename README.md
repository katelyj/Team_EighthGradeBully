*softdev pd9 -- final project*


# DESCRIPTION

Our project is a revamped version of Mr. Brooksâ€™s bell schedule application, but more aesthetically pleasing, and with user functionality, such as personal schedule overlay, bell warnings, and A/B days.

Check the bell schedule, whether it's an A or B day, log in and customize your home schedule to see which classes you have next... and more!
